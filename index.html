Yesterday morning rode with Bob to a train place in Philly. We thought there would be a showroom, but there was not. 
Bob left some locomotives to be repaired. Then lunch at Pete's Place. Played pool until dinner. 
Today I will head out after breakfast. Getting the truck washed and some Christmas shopping. 
Dinner with Paul, Sandy and Dan. 
Yesterday we also ordered the new heating system, with installation on Saturday. </p>

Traveled here yesterday to visit the Higgins. Found out that we need to replace the Chestertown furnace. 
Probably a $30K investment. 
Will talk to Diane and Joe about it this morning. Not sure what Bob and Pat have planned for today. </p>
